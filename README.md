## Database Saver
#### A small application through CLI to export databases, import them, and modify file content. Coded in Java in a plain project.

### Status:
- exportDatabase() Method is almost complete. Might need a bit more validation/error-handling.
- importDBExecutor() method needs testing, to make sure it works well.
- updateContentOfAuthOrChar() method needs v14 changed to v131, and perhaps some validation/error-handling/expanding.
- ToDo steps needs to be taken care of.

### ToDo:
- Documentation (Explain how to use it).
- Convert to a Maven project for better project/file structure
- Consider implementing Integration Testing
- Change the default texts on Scanner, to make it more clear/easier.
- Make the application more user-friendly. (Eg. implement an interface through the CLI).


### Future ToDo:
- Implement in GUI-mode.
- Implement verification of login authentication using PHP with REST, to authenticate Xenforo login. Or attempt with Java using BCrypt.
